This spell functions as [*oneiric horror*](/spells/oneiric-horror/) except each round the subject fails its Will save, it takes 1 point of Strength damage, and after the spell ends, the subject must succeed at a Fortitude save or be fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of rounds spent under the spell's effect.
