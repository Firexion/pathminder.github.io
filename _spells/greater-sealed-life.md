This spell functions as [*sealed life*](/spells/sealed-life/), except it additionally provides the benefits of *death ward* and renders its targets immune to effects that extract or transfer its soul, such as *possession* and *trap the soul*. This spell prevents a soul from returning to its body if it has already departed, until the spell's duration expires.
