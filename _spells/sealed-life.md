You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others. Affected creatures can't transfer damage to or from another, such as through *shield other*, a spiritualist's life bond, or a summoner's life link. Effects such as *vampiric touch* that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits.
