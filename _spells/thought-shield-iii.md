This functions as [*thought shield I*](/spells/thought-shield-i/), but the circumstance bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects increases to +8. In addition, any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1 round. This spell can be undercast.
