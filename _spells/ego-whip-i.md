You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target's ego, leaving the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The target takes a --2 penalty to that ability score, and is also staggered for the first round it's affected. A successful Will save negates the staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty to 1 round.
