This spell makes the duration of certain other spells permanent. You first cast the desired spell and then follow it with the *permanency* spell.

Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a specific gp value of diamond dust as a material component.

You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself. You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of *permanency* can be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.
