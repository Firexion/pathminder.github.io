Race traits are tied to specific races. Your character must be of the specified race to select a race trait. However, the background generator (*Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign*) draws from all lists, letting you ignore these restrictions. If using the background generator, you can take any trait you gain access to through it.
