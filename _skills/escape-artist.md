With Escape Artist, you can slip out of bonds and escape from grapples. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you’re not being actively opposed.

**Escape Bonds:** The table below gives the DCs and time needed to escape various forms of restraints. If the DC to escape bonds is higher than 20 + your Escape Artist skill bonus, you cannot escape from the bonds using Escape Artist.

| Restraint                                                              |       Time        |        DC        |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Rope/bindings                                                          |     1 minute      | Binder's CMB +20 |
| Net, *animate rope*, *command plants*, *control plants*, or *entangle* | Full-round action |        20        |
| *Snare* spell                                                          |     1 minute      |        23        |
| Manacles                                                               |     1 minute      |        30        |
| Masterwork manacles                                                    |     1 minute      |        35        |

**Fit Through Tight space:** With a DC 30 Escape Artist check and 1 minute or more of work, you can get through a space through which your head fits but your shoulders don’t. If the space is long, you may need to make multiple checks. You can’t squeeze through a space that your head does not fit through. You can make another check after a failed check if you’re squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks.

**Escape Grapple:** You can make an Escape Artist check in place of a combat maneuver check to escape a grapple or a pin.
