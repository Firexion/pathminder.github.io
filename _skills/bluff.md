You can use Bluff to deceive others, to pass secret messages, and to create diversions and feints in combat. The table shows uses of Bluff, the time they take, and whether you can try again with them.

| Bluff task          | Requires |          Time           | Retry |                            DC                            |

| Feign harmlessness  |   ---    |     1 round or more     |  Yes  |           Opposed by Sense Motive + modifiers            |
| Plant notion        |   ---    |        1 minute         |  Yes  |           Opposed by Sense Motive + modifiers            |

| Feint               |   ---    |     Standard action     |  Yes  | opposed by 10 + BAB + Wisdom, or 10 + Sense Motive bonus |
| Create diversion    |   ---    |           ---           |  Yes  |                 Opposed by Sense Motive                  |

**Deceive Someone:** Telling a lie is an opposed skill check against your opponent's Sense Motive skill. If you use Bluff to fool someone, with a successful check you convince your opponent that what you are saying is true. Bluff checks are modified depending upon the believability of the lie. The following modifiers are applied to the roll of the creature attempting to tell the lie. Note that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince anyone that they are true (subject to GM discretion). Attempting to deceive someone takes at least 1 round, but can possibly take longer if the lie is elaborate (as determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis).

If you fail to deceive someone, further attempts to deceive them are at a --10 penalty and may be impossible (GM discretion).

| Circumstances                   | Bluff Modifier |
|:--------------------------------|:--------------:|
| The target wants to believe you |       +5       |
| The lie is believable           |       +0       |
| The lie is unlikely             |      --5       |
| The lie is far-fetched          |      --10      |
| The lie is impossible           |      --20      |
| The target is drunk or impaired |       +5       |
| You possess convincing proof    |   up to +10    |

**Feign Harmlessness:** Rather than explicitly stating that you are harmless, you convince your target by exuding harmlessness through your actions and posture. This works like the deceive someone use of Bluff, except that if you are at least one size category smaller than your target and have taken no effective offensive actions that your target has seen, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on this check, as the target is convinced of its own unassailable superiority.

If you're attempting to feign harmlessness with a giant, even if you have proven yourself capable of dealing significant damage to a larger creature, an effort to present your previous success as a one-time fluke takes only a --10 penalty on the check for being unlikely, as giants easily believe the success of smaller creatures has more to do with luck than skill.

You can attempt to feign harmlessness to the same target again, but each previous failed check increases the DC to convince your target by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour has passed.

**Plant Notion:** You can gradually coax a target into thinking a suggestion is entirely its own idea, making the creature more likely to act on the idea than if you had suggested it outright. You discuss topics subtly relevant to the request, asking leading questions and narrowing the scope of the conversation so that the target eventually decides to take a specific action you have led it to.

You first attempt a Bluff check to convince the target that your request was actually its idea. This works like the deceive someone usage of Bluff and is always treated as far-fetched circumstances, resulting in a --10 penalty on the check. If successful, you can then attempt a Diplomacy check to make the request of the creature, treating its attitude toward you as indifferent for this single request (regardless of its actual attitude).

**Pass Secret Message:** You can use Bluff to pass hidden messages along to another character without others understanding your true meaning by using innuendo to cloak your actual message. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for complex messages. If you are successful, the target automatically understands you, assuming you are communicating in a language that it understands. If your check fails by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures that receive the message can decipher it by succeeding at an opposed Sense Motive check against your Bluff result. Using Bluff to deliver a secret message takes twice as long as the message would otherwise take to relay.

**Feint:** You can use Bluff to feint in combat, causing your opponent to be denied his Dexterity bonus to his AC against your next attack. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent's base attack bonus + your opponent's Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent's Sense Motive bonus, if higher. Feinting in combat is a standard action.

**Create Diversion:** You can use Bluff to allow you to use Stealth. A successful Bluff check opposed by the viewer's Sense Motive can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.
