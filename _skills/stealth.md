If people are observing you using any of their senses (but typically sight), you can't use Stealth. Against most creatures, having cover or concealment allows you to use Stealth. You can move up to half your normal speed and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than half but less than your normal speed, you take a --5 penalty. It's impossible to use Stealth while attacking, running, or charging.

If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check), you can attempt to use Stealth if you can get to an unobserved place of some kind. This check, however, is made at a --10 penalty because you have to move fast.

If you're invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if you're moving. You get a bonus or penalty on Stealth checks based on your size: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Medium +0, Large --4, Huge --8, Gargantuan --12, Colossal --16.

Your Stealth check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone who might notice you. Creatures that fail to beat your Stealth check are not aware of you and treat you as if you had total concealment.

**Breaking Stealth:** When you start your turn using Stealth, you can leave cover or concealment and remain unobserved as long as you succeed at a Stealth check and end your turn in cover or concealment. Your Stealth immediately ends after you make an attack roll, whether or not the attack is successful (except when sniping as noted below).

**Sniping:** If you've already successfully used Stealth at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack and then immediately take a move action to use Stealth again. You take a --20 penalty on your Stealth check to maintain your obscured location.

**Hide Behind Creature:** Normally the soft cover provided by other creatures is not sufficient to allow you to attempt a Stealth check. Soft cover provided by creatures at least one size category larger than you does allow you to attempt Stealth checks against other creatures not already aware of your presence at a --10 penalty. If the creature providing the cover knows which square you occupy and is trying to avoid concealing you, this penalty increases to --20.

You can also hide from a creature by staying under its own body if it is at least two size categories larger than you and you are in its space. Such attempts also take a –10 penalty, which increases to a –20 penalty if the creature is aware you are in the area. If the creature moves away from you, you are automatically revealed, unless you have readied an action to move with it.
