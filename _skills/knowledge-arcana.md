**Identify Aura:** This works as the identify aura functionality of [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft/), except that you can also identify auras on creatures.

**Identify Spell Effect:** You can identify a spell that's already in place and in effect. You must be able to see or detect the effects of the spell.

**Identify Magic Creation:** You can identify materials created or shaped by magic, such as noting that a particular object was created using a transmutation spell.

**Identify Targeted Spell:** After rolling a saving throw against a spell targeted on you, you can try to determine what that spell was.
