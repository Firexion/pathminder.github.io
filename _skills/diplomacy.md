You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem.

**Change Attitude:** With 1 minute of continuous interaction, you can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters. The DC of this check depends on the creature's starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the character's attitude toward you is improved by one step. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character's attitude toward you increases by one additional step.

A creature's attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations.

If you fail the check by 4 or less, the character's attitude toward you is unchanged. If you fail by 5 or more, the character's attitude toward you is decreased by one step.

You cannot use Diplomacy against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence of 3 or less. Diplomacy is generally ineffective in combat and against creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future.

Any attitude shift caused through Diplomacy generally lasts for 1d4 hours but can last much longer or shorter depending upon the situation (GM discretion). You cannot use Diplomacy to influence a given creature's attitude more than once in a 24-hour period.

| Starting Attitude |              DC              |
|:------------------|:----------------------------:|
| Hostile           | 25 + creature's Cha modifier |
| Unfriendly        | 20 + creature's Cha modifier |
| Indifferent       | 15 + creature's Cha modifier |
| Friendly          | 10 + creature's Cha modifier |
| Helpful           | 0 + creature's Cha modifier  |

**Make Request:** If a creature's attitude toward you is at least indifferent, you can make requests of the creature with 1 or more rounds of interaction. This is a Diplomacy check, using the creature's current attitude to determine the base DC, with one of the following modifiers.

Once a creature's attitude has shifted to helpful, the creature gives in to most requests without a check, unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril.

Some requests automatically fail if the request goes against the creature's values or its nature, subject to GM discretion. If a request is refused, the result does not change with additional checks, although other requests might be made.

| Request                                  |  DC Modifier   |
|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------:|
| Give simple advice or directions         |      --5       |
| Give detailed advice                     |       +0       |
| Give simple aid                          |       +0       |
| Reveal an unimportant secret             |       +5       |
| Give lengthy or complicated aid          |       +5       |
| Give dangerous aid                       |      +10       |
| Reveal an important secret               |  +10 or more   |
| Give aid that could result in punishment |  +15 or more   |
| Additional requests                      | +5 per request |

**Gather Information:** You can also use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual. To do this, you must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places. The DC of this check depends on the obscurity of the information sought, but for most commonly known facts or rumors it is 10. For obscure or secret knowledge, the DC might increase to 20 or higher. The GM might rule that some topics are simply unknown to common folk.

**Hypnotism:** You must be trained in Survival and be capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat to use this functionality of the skill. You can use hypnotism once per day. The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subjectâ€™s Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects.

*Implant Suggestion:* You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a suggestion spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each round to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher.

*Recall Memory:* You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 bonus. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to.
