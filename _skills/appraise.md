You can use Appraise evaluate the monetary value of an object. Retrying Appraise checks with the same items gives you the same results. The table shows uses of Appraise and the time they take.

| Appraise tasks               |       Action        |     DC     |
|:-----------------------------|:-------------------:|:----------:|
| Appraise common item or work |  1 standard action  |     20     |
| Appraise rare item or work   |  1 standard action  | 25 or more |
| Evaluate hoard               | 1 full-round action | 20 or more |

**Appraise Item:** By taking 1 standard action, you can evaluate the monetary value of an object. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item's abilities.

If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion.

**Evaluate Hoard:** By taking 1 full-round action, you can determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.
