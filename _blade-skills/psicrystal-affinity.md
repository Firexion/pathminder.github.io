The soulknife gains the Psicrystal Affinity feat with this blade skill, and she may use her soulknife level in place of her manifester level to determine the effectiveness of her psicrystal or to meet requirements or prerequisites for abilities, feats, powers, or item usage (but not for prestige classes) related to her psicrystal.
