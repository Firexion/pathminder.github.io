As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style that a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you take a swift action to switch styles or the combat encounter ends, whichever occurs first. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while you are in the stance of the associated style.
