{{ site.github.project_title }} is a collection of Pathfinder content intended to produce characters of more-or-less equal power levels. To this end, the site contains classes and other material sourced from multiple publishers, as well as pre-archetyped classes intended to better fit an average power level than the unarchetyped versions.
