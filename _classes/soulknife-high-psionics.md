      As a move action, a soulknife can form a semi-solid weapon composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind.

      A soulknife must choose the form of his mind blade at 1st level. He can either form it into a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon. Once chosen, his mind blade stays in this form every time the soulknife forms his mind blade. The light weapon deals 1d6 points of damage, the one-handed weapon deals 1d8 points of damage, and the two-handed weapon deals 2d6 points of damage. All damages are based on a Medium- sized creature wielding Medium-sized weapons; adjust the weapon damage as appropriate for different sized weapons. In all forms, the mind blade has a critical range of 19-20/x2. A soulknife with powerful build or any similar ability forms an appropriately-sized mind blade dealing the size-appropriate amount of damage.

      If the soulknife's chosen form is a light weapon, he may choose to form two light weapons when forming his mind blade if he so chooses, but he suffers the standard penalties for two-weapon fighting.

      Regardless of the weapon form a soulknife has chosen, his mind blade does not have a set damage type. When shaping his weapon and assigning abilities to it, the soulknife chooses whether it will deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. The soulknife may change the damage type of an existing mind blade, or may summon a new mind blade with a different damage type, as a full-round action; otherwise, the mind blade retains the last damage type chosen every time it is summoned.

      The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and is considered a masterwork weapon.

      A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose his mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Focus and Improved Critical. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade. The soulknife can use feats such as Weapon Finesse that work on light weapons with his mind blade, but such feats only work on mind blades in a light weapon form.

      Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again, although the mind blade is treated for all purposes as a non-magical, masterwork weapon while in a place where psionic effects do not normally function. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes.

      As a move action on her turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics-negating effect. He gains a bonus on Will saves made to maintain or form his mind blade equal to the total enhancement bonus of his mind blade (see below).

      The soulknife chooses the appearance of his mind blade, although its shape must reflect the selections the soulknife has chosen: a bludgeoning mind blade would be blunt, slashing would have an edge, etc.

  - name: shape mind blade
    text: |
      The soulknife's mind blade retains the last chosen form every time it is formed until the soulknife reshapes it. If the soulknife chooses to reshape his blade, it requires a full-round action to do so. She may also re-assign the type of damage dealt as part of reshaping his mind blade if he so chooses.

      A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade; see below. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. These cannot be the normal 8 hours used for rest, even if the soulknife does not require sleep. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.

  - name: throw mind blade
    levels: [1]
    text: |
      All soulknives have some knowledge of how to throw their mind blades, though the range increment varies by form and the largest of blade forms cannot be thrown. Light weapon mind blades have a range increment of 20 ft. One-handed weapon mind blades have a range increment of 15 ft. Two-handed weapon mind blades cannot be thrown without the Two-Handed Throw blade skill. Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates.

  - name: wild talent
    levels: [1]

      The soulknife gains Wild Talent as a bonus feat at 1st level. This provides his with the psionic power necessary to manifest his mind blade. A character who is already psionic instead gains the Psionic Talent feat.

      Beginning at 2nd level and every even soulknife level thereafter, a soulknife may choose one of a number of abilities to add to his repertoire. Some blade skills have prerequisites that must be met before they can be chosen. All blade skills may only be chosen once and require the soulknife to be using his mind blade unless otherwise stated in the skill's description.

      *Absorbing Blade:* The soulknife may expend his psychic strike to have his mind blade absorb a spell, spell-like ability, power, or psi-like ability that would affect her. Effects that are not subjected to spell resistance or power resistance cannot be absorbed in this fashion. Effects that target an area or multiple targets are only absorbed for the soulknife; other affected targets are still affected normally. The level of the effect cannot exceed the number of dice of psychic strike expended. The soulknife must be 8th level to select this blade skill. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

      *Additional Configuration:* The soulknife gains the abil- ity to have a separate configuration for his mind blade's enhancement bonus and special abilities. When he forms his mind blade, the soulknife may choose either configuration. Creating this extra configuration functions just as reassigning the enhancement of his mind blade, typically 8 hours of concentration, and when the soulknife reassigns his mind blade configuration, he must reassign each configuration separately, taking the normal 8 hours of concentration per configuration. Additionally, the soulknife may configure the off-hand light weapon form of his mind blade separately from the main hand configuration, if he chooses to form two mind blades and spends the normal 8 hours of concentration. The off-hand mind blade in both configurations can be separately configured in this way. If a soulknife with a separate off-hand configuration forms a one-handed or two-handed mind blade, it always uses the current configuration set for the main hand, never the off-hand configuration. The soulknife must be at least 6th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Advanced Talents:* The soulknife can select an advanced rogue talent from the following list: Confounding Blades, Crippling Strike, Stealthy Sniper. The soulknife can select this blade skill multiple times. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature and be at least 10th level before selecting this blade skill.

      *Alter Blade:* The soulknife gains the ability to shape his mind blade into different weapon forms. She may change his blade's form to the light weapon, one-handed weapon, or two-handed weapon forms any time he forms his mind blade. Additionally, the soulknife may choose to form his mind blade into a one-handed weapon and a light weapon instead of two light weapons.

      *Animal Senses:* The soulknife's senses sharpen to animal-like levels. She gains low-light vision (if she already possessed this, then she does not gain any visual bonuses), a +2 bonus on Perception checks, and the scent special ability. The soulknife must possess the form claws class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Blade Rush:* The soulknife rushes forward with a dash of incredible speed. As a swift action, the soulknife may expend her psionic focus and move up to her speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. The soulknife must be at least 6th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Blade Rush Frenzy:* The soulknife can expend her psionic focus as a full-round action to move up to her speed without provoking attacks of opportunity and make a single melee attack against each creature she is adjacent to at any point in her movement. Each attack is made at her highest base attack bonus with a â€“2 penalty on the attack roll. The soulknife must be at least 8th level and possess the Blade Rush blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Bladestorm:* As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, the soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead throw one mind blade at his full attack bonus at all opponents within 30 feet, ignoring the normal range increments for throwing a mind blade. Regardless of the number of attacks he makes, he only provokes attacks of opportunity as though he made a single ranged attack. The soulknife must possess the Bladewind blade skill to take this ability, this ability may not be used if the mind blade is in a two-handed weapon form, and the soulknife must be at least 16th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Bladewind:* The soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.

      As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.

      When using bladewind, the soulknife can choose to expend his psychic strike if an attack miss to reroll that attack, but none of the bladewind attacks deal any extra damage from psychic strike.

      When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as Cleave or haste). The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack. A soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Caltrop Spray:* The soulknife is capable of shattering and scattering her mind blade into dozens of tiny pieces to lay down caltrops over an area as a standard action. The soulknife must be wielding her mind blade to use this blade skill, and she destroys it to create this effect (she can re-manifest it as normal). For each die of psychic strike damage she has (minimum of 1), the soulknife lays down a 5-foot area of caltrops within 30 feet of her. Unlike normal caltrops, these psychically-created traps harbor the soulknife's will within them, and gain a bonus on their attack rolls equal to her Wisdom modifier. In addition, they can tell friend from foe, and never attack or damage the soulknife's allies. These caltrops count as magic weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, and exist for a number of rounds equal to the soulknife's class level.

      *Cleave Space:* By using the potential psychic power that resides within her mind blade, the soulknife may carve through the veil between planes and slip gently through it to another location nearby. The soulknife must be wielding her mind blade to use to use this blade skill. As a standard action, the soulknife expends her psionic focus and cuts through the world around her, teleporting as if she had manifested the *fold space* power with a manifester level equal to her soulknife level. Just as with the *fold space* power, the use of this ability ends her turn. At 16th level, the soulknife can use this ability as a move action. This blade skill meets the prerequisites for and functions with Dimensional Agility and feats that require it as a prerequisite. The soulknife must be at least 10th level and possess the Ghost Step blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Combat Slide:* Upon successfully striking an enemy in melee, the soulknife may immediately make a 5-foot step (even if she's already moved in the round, but not if she's taken a 5-foot step). In addition, when someone misses the soulknife with a melee attack, he may spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step.

      *Dazzling Blade:* The soulknife may, as a standard action, channel psionic energy into his mind blade, dazzling all creatures within 30 feet. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. The save DC is 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus.

      *Deadly Blow:* The soulknife's mind blade critical multiplier increases by 1. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Deadly Shield:* The soulknife may choose to empower his mind shield with weapon special abilities, instead of shield special abilities, and may select to apply the enhancement bonus of the mind shield for attacks, rather than for armor. The soulknife must have the Form Mind Shield class feature and be at least 5th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Deceptive Blade:* When the soulknife feints in combat, he may also form his mind blade in the same action as the feint. Additionally, Bluff is now a class skill for the soulknife. If the soulknife has the Improved Feint feat and the psychic strike class feature, once per round he may also charge his psychic strike when performing a feint and forming his mind blade in the same action. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

      *Devastating Blade:* Improving on the principles of the Knife to the Soul blade skill, the soulknife has learned to refine this art into a truly destructive ability. When using the Knife to the Soul blade skill, the soulknife can damage any ability score instead of just mental ability scores, and deals 2 points of ability damage per psychic strike die instead of 1. The soulknife must be at least 16th level and possess the Knife to the Soul blade skill to select this blade skill.

      *Dispelling Strike:* With this blade skill, the soulknife is capable of channeling her psychic strike damage into caustic, anti-psionic energy. As a standard action, the soulknife can expend her psionic focus and her psionic strike to make an attack with her mind blade (or equivalent weapon). If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the soulknife affects the target with a targeted *dispel psionics* power as a psi-like ability, with a manifester level equal to her class level. The soulknife does not apply the expended psychic strike's damage to her attack. The soulknife must be 8th level to select this blade skill.

      *Disrupting Strike:* As a full-round action, a soulknife can make one melee attack against each enemy adjacent to her. If he hits, the attack deals no damage, but each enemy hit takes a -5 penalty to all melee and ranged damage rolls until the start of the soulknife's next turn. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

      *Dual Imbue:* When utilizing multiple mind blades, the soulknife may charge both blades with his psychic strike ability at the same time (including when expending his focus to charge his psychic strike). However, his psychic strike damage is reduced by 1d8 when using this option. Damage remains normal when each weapon is charged separately.

      *Dueling Blade:* When a soulknife is fighting defensively, or using the Combat Expertise feat, with a mind blade, and an opponent misses his in melee, he may expend his psionic focus to make an attack of opportunity against that opponent with his mind blade. The soulknife ignores the penalty to attack rolls from fighting defensively for this attack.

      *Empowered Fist:* The soulknife learns to manifest her mind blade as a field of destructive energy as well as the forms her mind blade normally may take. Selection of this blade skill grants the empowered strikes class feature (see soulbolt archetype), and the soulknife gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. The soulknife's empower strikes gain the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind blade, and she may select its own enhancements (such as distance or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind blade. The soulknife may now also take deadly fis specific blade skills. This cannot be taken if you possess the empowered strikes class feature previously. The soulknife must be at least 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Empowered Natural Weapons:* The deadly fist may treat any natural attacks she possesses as unarmed strikes for the purposes of class features that affect unarmed strikes and for the Flurry of Fists blade skill, as well as blade skills that require it as a prerequisite).

      *Emulate Melee Weapon:* The soulknife can form his mind blade to replicate any single melee weapon, chosen at the time he takes this blade skill. The soulknife is proficient with his mind blade in this form and it functions in all ways as the chosen weapon. This blade skill may be taken multiple times; each time, it allows the soulknife to form his mind blade to replicate a different melee weapon. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

      *Emulate Ranged Weapon:* The soulknife can form his mind bolt to replicate any single ranged weapon (except firearms), chosen at the time he takes this blade skill. The soulknife is proficient with his mind bolt in this form and it functions in all ways as the chosen weapon. This blade skill may be taken multiple times; each time, it allows the soulknife to form his mind bolt to replicate a different ranged weapon (except firearms). The soulknife must have the ability to form a mind bolt to select this blade skill.

      *Energized Shield:* As an immediate action when the soulknife is attacked in melee and by expending his psionic focus, he may charge his mind shield with one of the energy types he could normally make his mind blade deal, dealing additional points of the appropriate type of energy damage equal to his normal psychic strike damage to his attacker. This effect lasts only for one attack. The soulknife must be at least 8th level and have the mind shield blade skill and one of the fire blade, ice blade, lightning blade, or thunder blade blade skills to choose this blade skill.

      *Enhanced Range:* The soulknife's range increment when throwing his mind blade in any form doubles.

      *Evasion:* The soulknife can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the soulknife is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of evasion. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Expand Shield:* When using the total defense action or attacking defensively, as a free action on his turn the soulknife can transform his mind shield into a tower shield until the start of his next turn. All of the standard penalties for having a mind shield shaped as a tower shield apply. The soulknife must have the Mind Shield blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      *Exploding Critical:* When a soulknife confirms a critical hit, he can expend his psionic focus to deal his psychic strike damage, even if his mind blade was not charged with psychic strike, and even if he already dealt psychic strike on the attack. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Extended Strike:* A soulknife may, as a standard action, make a single attack as if his reach was 5 ft. longer. This blade skill may be combined with the twin strike blade skill. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Fire Blade:* When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal fire damage instead of its normal damage. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to deal an additional +1d10 fire damage. The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Firestorm:* When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to damage an enemy via the Fire Blade blade skill, if the damaged target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, the soulknife deals 1d10 additional fire damage to it and each enemy within 10 feet of the damaged target. The soulknife must have the Fire Blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      *Fluid Form:* The soulknife may expend his psychic strike as a swift action, but deal no psychic strike damage, to make a minor modification to his mind blade. She may remove up to one weapon special ability (if any) from his mind blade's configuration, and add the ability's value to the mind blade's enhancement bonus. She may also add up to one weapon special ability to his mind blade's configuration, and subtract the ability's value from the mind blade's enhancement bonus. Once he had made either or both of these changes, the mind blade suffers a -1 penalty to its enhancement bonus; this penalty is cumulative with each time this blade skill is used, and lasts until the soulknife rests for 8 hours or spends 8 hours in concentration to reconfigure his mind blade. This blade skill may not be used if this would reduce the mind blade's enhancement bonus below +1, or if the final enhancement bonus would be above the soulknife's maximum.

      *Fluid Form, Improved:* When the soulknife uses the Fluid Form blade skill, he may change all of his mind blade's weapon special abilities simultaneously. The mind blade still suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to its enhancement bonus when the Fluid Form blade skill is used. A soulknife must have the Fluid Form blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      *Flurry of Fists:* When making unarmed attacks and making a full attack, the soulknife can make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus, but all attacks in the full attack suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll. This extra attack does not stack with abilities that grant additional attacks, such as Two-Weapon Fighting, Flurry of Blows, or other such effects. The soulknife must have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat in order to select this blade skill.

      *Flurry of Fists, Improved:* The soulknife gains an additional attack when using flurry of fists, but at a -5 penalty. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and the Flurry of Fists blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Flurry of Fists, Greater:* The soulknife gains an additional attack when using flurry of fists, but at a -10 penalty. The soulknife must be at least 11th level and have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and the Flurry of Fists and Improved Flurry of Fists blade skills in order to select this blade skill.

      *Focused Defense:* When fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise or the total defense action, the soulknife adds his Wisdom modifier as a dodge bonus to his AC so long as he maintains psionic focus. The soulknife must be at least 4th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Focused Offense:* As long as the soulknife maintains psionic focus, he adds his Wisdom modifier to his attack and damage rolls instead of his Strength modifier.

      *Freezing Ice:* When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to slow an enemy via the Ice Blade blade skill, if the slowed target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the soulknife's next turn. The soulknife must have the Ice Blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      *Full Enhancement:* When forming his mind blade into multiple items, the soulknife suffers no reduction in enhancement bonus.

      *Furious Charge:* A soulknife with this ability deals an additional 2 points of damage on every attack made at the end of a charge. The increased damage is only 1 per attack for off-hand attacks, but becomes 3 per attack when using the two-handed form of the mind blade.

      *Furious Charge, Improved:* A soulknife with this ability can expend his psychic strike while making a charge to make an additional attack with his main hand, albeit at a -5 penalty on the attack roll, at the end of a charge action. If the soulknife is wielding two mind blades and has the Twin Strike blade skill, he may instead make an additional attack with each mind blade, but each of these additional attacks suffers a -5 penalty on the attack roll in addition to the penalties for attacking with two weapons. The soulknife does not apply the expended psychic strike's damage to his attacks. The soulknife may only gain the benefit of this blade skill once on any charge. The soulknife must have the Furious Charge blade skill and be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Ghost Step:* The soulknife has learned a potent trick that some call the 'ghost step'; a teleportation-based principle that allows the soulknife to slip between nearby places at great speed. As a move action, the soulknife can expend her psionic focus to teleport to any location she can see within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 soulknife levels). She can carry no more than 50 lbs. of additional gear, and cannot bring creatures other than her psicrystal (if she has one) with her. The use of this ability ends the soulknife's turn. At 10th level, the this ability can be used to teleport up to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per soulknife level), and she may teleport as a swift action instead of a move action. This is a teleportation effect. This blade skill meets the prerequisites for and functions with Dimensional Agility and feats that require it as a prerequisite. The soulknife must be at least 4th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Grasping Shield:* The soulknife's mind shield takes on an adhesive quality. Once per round, he may make a free disarm attempt against any enemy that makes a melee attack that misses her. This disarm attempt counts as an attack of opportunity and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The soulknife must have the shield block blade skill and the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

      *Gruesome Riposte:* The soulknife may expend his psionic focus as an immediate action to attack an enemy who has successfully struck his in melee. This attack is assumed to happen after the successful attack, so he cannot use this ability if the attack would put his below 0 hit points, nor does dropping his enemy below 0 hit points prevent the attack from hitting. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Ice Blade:* When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal cold damage instead of its normal damage. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to reduce the target's speed by half until the end of the soulknife's next turn. The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Improved Armor:* The soulknife's mind armor improves depending on its form. Light form is treated as if not wearing armor, while still gaining the armor bonus to Armor Class. Medium form is treated as a masterwork breastplate. Heavy form is treated as masterwork full plate. The soulknife must have the ability to form mind armor in order to take this blade skill.

      *Improved Enhancement:* The soulknife's enhancement bonus on his mind blade increases by 1. This increase may be used to increase the actual enhancement bonus of the mind blade (to a maximum of +5) or be spent on weapon special abilities, as normal. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Improved Evasion (Ex):* This works like evasion, except that while the soulknife still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. A soulknife must have the Evasion blade skill, the Covert Training class feature, and be at least 10th level before selecting this blade skill.

      *Improved Deadly Shield:* The soulknife retains her enhancement bonus and shield special defensive properties on her mind shield while still gaining weapon-like traits from the Deadly Shield blade skill. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and possess the Deadly Shield blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Improved Mind Armaments:* The soulknife is capable of shaping her mind blade as well as her mind armor in the same action. She may manifest both as a move action, and starting at 10th level she may manifest both mind blade and mind armor as a swift action. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and have the form mind armaments class feature in order to select this blade skill.

      *Improved Mind Shield:* The shield bonus to AC granted by the soulknife's mind shield increases by 1. The soulknife must have the mind shield blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Improved Psychokinetic Discharge:* The deadly fist is capable of launching volleys of discharged psychokinetic energy more efficiently, allowing her empowered strikes class feature to remain empowered to allow for full attack actions to be made at range. The range of these attacks increases to 30 feet and may be used with the deadly fist's Flurry of Fists blade skill (and subsequent blade skills that improve it). The soulknife must be at least 6th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Interrupting Throw:* If an enemy within 10 feet of the soulknife performs an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity, such as casting a spell without casting on the defensive, he may, as an immediate action and by expending psionic focus, throw his mind shield at that enemy as an attack of opportunity. The soulknife may not use this blade skill if his mind shield is in the form of a tower shield. The soulknife must be at least 12th level and have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

      *Knife to the Soul:* The soulknife gains the knife to the soul ability. When a soulknife with knife to the soul executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (her choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses. A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so long as no more than half of the soulknife's extra dice of damage are converted to ability damage. Knife to the soul may only be used once per round.

      Unlike the base psychic strike ability, knife to the soul is entirely reliant on the creature's mind, and cannot be used on creatures immune to mind-affecting abilities. The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Lightning Arc:* When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to penalize an enemy via the Lightning Blade blade skill, if the penalized target is adjacent to the soulknife at the end of its next turn, it is dazzled for one round and another enemy within 30 feet of the target takes 3d6 electricity damage. A successful Reflex Save (DC 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus) halves the damage taken. The soulknife must have the lightning blade blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      *Lightning Blade:* When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal electricity damage instead of its normal damage. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to give the target a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls until the end of his next turn. If the target is wearing metal armor, the penalty increases to -3. The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Launch Multibolt:* The soulknife gains the benefits of the Manyshot feat with her mindbolt. The soulknife must possess the Launch Mindbolt class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Mark of the Challenger:* The soulknife charges his mind blade with the ability to cause an enemy to focus on her. As a standard action, the soulknife makes a melee attack against a creature. If the attack is successful, the target takes a -2 penalty to attacks made against targets other than the soulknife until the end of its next turn.

      *Mental Power:* The soulknife gains an additional power known from the gifted blade power list, up to the maximum power level he can manifest. In addition, the soulknife gains an additional 2 power points. This blade skill can be selected multiple times. Each time, the soulknife gains another power known and 2 additional power points. The soulknife must have manifesting ability from his levels in soulknife in order to select this blade skill.

      *Mind Blade Finesse:* The benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat apply to the mind blade even when it is in forms that cannot normally be the subject of Weapon Finesse (including two-handed forms).

      *Mind Daggers:* The soulknife may form one or a pair of mind daggers in place of his normal forms. Mind daggers have a range increment of 30 ft when thrown, deal 1d4 points of damage (type assigned in the same manner as other forms) and have a critical range of 19- 20/x2. She may switch between mind daggers and his chosen blade form at will as a free action, including in the middle of full attacks, and it can be done more than once per round (this is an exception to the full-round action normally required to shape a mind blade). She cannot switch between the daggers and the two-handed mind blade form unless only forming a single dagger. Mind daggers have the same enhancement configuration as the soulknife's current mind blade configuration.

      *Mind Shield:* The soulknife gains a +2 shield bonus to armor class, as long as he has a hand free.

      *Mindflayer:* The soulknife with this blade skill may channel her psionic energies into a long, thin mind whip of mental strength that is capable of both flaying body and mind. The whip functions in all respects as whip or scorpion whip (chosen when manifesting a mind blade using this blade skill). While in this form, the soulknife is considered to be proficient with both weapons. Mindflayer is compatible with the Whip Mastery feat (and subsequent feats). The soulknife may expend her psionic focus when making an attack using her psychic strike to cause intense levels of pain with her mind whip. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 soulknife level + Wisdom modifier) or become dazed for one round. The soulknife must be 6th level to select this blade skill.

      *Multi-Blade Manifestation:* The soulknife who possesses this blade skill is capable of splitting his mind blade further than others of his kind due to having more than two limbs capable of wielding a weapon. Limbs capable of wielding mind blades after the first two can be armed with light weapon versions of her mind blade; just as when using shape mind blade to create multiple mind blades, the enhancement bonus is reduced by one for these blades as well. The soulknife must be 6th level to select this blade skill and must possess three or more hands (or their equivalent) to select this blade skill.

      *Multiple Throw:* The soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make. A soulknife must be at least 14th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Power Reserve:* The soulknife's innate psychic essence is stronger than others of her kind, growing more powerful as she advances in level. The power point pool granted by the Wild Talent (or Psionic Talent) feat that the soulknife receives at 1st level increases in size by two points per soulknife level (the soulknife does not gain bonus power points for having a high ability score from this ability). If the soulknife possesses a power pool from another source (such as by being 3rd level or higher), this feature adds to that power pool instead. These points may be used to manifest powers (if any are known) and support other abilities that require use of a power point pool. Once selected, the soulknife must rest for 8 hours every day to gain or recover these power points. This blade skill may only be selected once.

      *Powerful Strikes:* The soulknife's psychic strike deals an additional 1d8 damage.

      *Psicrystal Affinity:* The soulknife gains the Psicrystal Affinity feat with this blade skill, and she may use her soulknife level in place of her manifester level to determine the effectiveness of her psicrystal or to meet requirements or prerequisites for abilities, feats, powers, or item usage (but not for prestige classes) related to her psicrystal.

      *Psionic Grapnel:* The soulknife's Psychic Net gains new versatility, gaining the ability to reel her opponent in towards her reach: or she can use this connection to her psychic net to vault herself towards her target instead. This functions as as a psi-like ability of the power *ectoplasmic grapnel*, using the character's soulknife level as her manifester level. When using this blade skill, the soulknife may substitute her Wisdom score for her Strength score when making CMB checks for this ability. If choosing to launch herself towards her target, she may move along her connection to the target as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to how swiftly she moves. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and possess the Psychic Net blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      *Ranged Shield Block:* When using the Shield Block blade skill, the soulknife may block a ranged attack, but not ranged touch attack. The soulknife must have the form mind shield class feature and the shield block blade skill to choose this blade skill.

      Psionic Training: Gain a psionic feat instead of selecting a blade skill. The soulknife must meet all prerequisites of the psionic feat selected. She may not select the feat Extra Blade Skill with this blade skill. This blade skill may be selected multiple times.

      *Psychic Net:* The soulknife may generate a temporary field of energy in the form of a heavy net of psychic power created from her mind blade. By throwing a mind blade at a target and expending his psionic focus, it rapidly expands into an ectoplasmic construct that envelops the target as if the soulknife had manifested the entangling ectoplasm psionic power (in lieu of causing damage from the thrown weapon). Treat this as a psi-like ability that uses the character's soulknife level as the effective manifester level of the power and the DC to break free of this net with a Strength check is Wisdom-based. The soulknife must be at least 4th level in order to select this blade skill.

      *Psychic Platform:* The soulknife produces a disk of solid, barely luminous force beneath her feet on which to stand. As an immediate action, the soulknife expends her psionic focus to generate this psychic construct which acts as a 5-foot circle of force that exists for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) or until the soulknife is no longer standing on it. This platform is either stationary and may float in mid-air or in liquid, or it is subject to gravity as normal (the soulknife chooses upon manifesting the platform) and has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. This platform can be elastic (allowing for the soulknife to be treated as if she had a running start for checks made to jump), slick (to allow for sliding down surfaces such as hills or staircases), and/or 'sticky', where the soulknife may stick to it at an otherwise impossible angles (such as upside down or at 90 degree or more angles) at her will. Many uses of this platform are subject to GM decision (Acrobatics checks for jumping or balancing, for example). Actions related to the use of this platform gain a competence bonus on checks equal to the soulknife's enhancement bonus on her mind blade. The soulknife must be at least 6th level and possess the Telekinetic Athletics blade skill in order to select this blade skill.

      Psychic Strike: The soulknife gains the psychic strike class feature. When learned, this skill allows the soulknife to add an additional 1d8 points of damage to an attack with her mind blade, as per the psychic strike class feature. This may be improved by the Powerful Strikes blade skill. The soulknife must not previously possess the psychic strike class feature to select this blade skill. The soulknife must be 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Psychic Toolkit:* By concentrating her mind blade down into tiny slivers of hardened thought, the soulknife can create tools with which to perform a variety of tasks that she otherwise would need to use specialized tools for. With this blade skill, the soulknife may manifest her mind blade into different tools (artisans tools, a blanket, a mess kit, a thief's toolkit, a 10-foot. pole, the form of a 50-foot silk rope with grappling hook, or more with GM discretion) as a move action. These tools add the mind blade's enhancement bonus as a competence bonus on skill checks when using these tools, and if relevant they possess the standard hardness, hit points, and break DC of items of these types. The soulknife must maintain contact with these tools for them to remain cohesive. Upon reaching 5th level, these tools can be generated as a swift action.

      *Psychokinetic Armor:* The soulknife may form mind armor as if she possessed the mind armaments class feature (see armored blade soulknife archetype); this only allows her to form mind armor from the mind armaments class feature (weapons must be formed from another ability). She may form the mind armor as a move action and remains until it is dismissed (free action) or until she is knocked unconscious or dead. She uses the mind armaments enhancement bonus from the armored blade archetype to determine the mind armor's enhancement bonus based on her soulknife level and may select armor special abilities from that archetype. As usual, whenever the soulknife forms multiple items, the enhancement bonus of all items she forms decrease by 1 per item formed after the first. She may also shape the form of her mind armor as if she possessed the shape mind armaments class feature (mind armor only). Unlike the mind armaments class feature of the armored blade, psychokinetic armor is not subject to the benefits of the Improved Enhancement blade skill. This functions otherwise in all ways as the mind armaments class feature for the purposes of prerequisites and requirements. The soulknife must be 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Psychokinetic Blast:* The soulknife may cause her psychic strike to explode out from her target into a sudden burst of psychokinetic energy. When making an attack, the soulknife expends her psychic strike to deal her psychic strike damage to her target as well as all adjacent creatures to the target (excluding the soulknife). The soulknife must be 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Psychokinetic Grenade:* The soulknife may charge her mind blade (or equivalent ability) with explosive psychokinetic energies. As a standard action, the soulknife uses her throw mind blade class feature (or equivalent ability) against a target creature. This attack must be charged by her psychic strike class feature. Upon successfully hitting the target, the attack explodes with psychokinetic power as if it were a splash weapon against targets within a 10-foot-radius zone from the targeted creature. The splash damage is equal to her psychic strike damage plus her mind blade enhancement bonus per psychic strike die. The soulknife may apply the following blade skills to her psychokinetic grenades: Fire Blade, Ice Blade, Lightning Blade, or Thunder Blade. The soulknife must be 6th level to select this blade skill.

      *Reaching Blade:* The soulknife may expend his focus to increase his reach with his mind blade by 5 feet until the start of his next turn. Unlike normal reach weapons, a soulknife may also attack adjacent opponents with his mind blade. A soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Reaper's Blade:* A soulknife with this ability automatically recharges his psychic strike ability if he reduces an enemy's hit points to below 0 with a melee attack using his mind blade. If his blade was already charged, his next psychic strike deals 1.5 times the damage rolled. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Reflective Blade:* A soulknife may expend his psychic strike as an immediate action to reflect a spell or power that would strike his back at the caster. The spell or power must be a touch attack spell or power, either ranged or melee, and the level of the spell or power reflected cannot exceed the number of dice of damage expended by psychic strike. The soulknife makes a ranged touch attack to determine if the spell successfully strikes the target. The soulknife must be at least 14th level and have the Absorbing Blade blade skill to select this blade skill.

      *Rending Blades:* Hooks extend from the soulknife's mind blade, dealing an additional 1d6 bleed damage on a critical hit, and giving a competence bonus on Climb checks equal to the enhancement bonus of the mind blade.

      *Resounding Thunder:* When the soulknife expends his psionic focus to stagger an enemy via the Thunder Blade blade skill, he gains an additional benefit. If the target ends its next turn adjacent to the soulknife, it takes 2d6+2 sonic damage. The soulknife must have the Thunder Blade blade skill to select this blade skill.

      *Rogue Talent:* The soulknife can select a rogue talent from the following list. Befuddling Strike, Fast Stealth, Slow Reactions, Sniper's Eye, Surprise Attack. The soulknife can select this blade skill multiple times. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Shield Block:* As an immediate action and by expending psionic focus, the soulknife may block one melee attack, but not touch attack, against his by making an attack roll. If his attack roll is higher than the attack roll he is attempting to block, the attack misses. The soulknife must have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

      *Stealth Armaments:* Whenever the soulknife forms mind armor using her mind armaments class feature (or the Psychokinetic Armor blade skill), her mind armor gains the appearance and benefits of a mundane outfit worth 200gp or less. The soulknife must possess the ability to form mind armor to select this blade skill.

      *Stunning Blade:* By channeling disruptive psionic energies through her mind blade, the soulknife may stun her foes with her psychic strike. When attacking a foe with her mind blade, she may expend her psychic strike and her psionic focus to stun her target. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the soulknife's class level + the soulknife's Wisdom modifier) or become stunned for 1 round (until just before your next turn). This blade skill also counts as the Stunning Fist feat for the purposes of fulfilling prerequisites or for effects and abilities that modify or use the feat. The soulknife must be 6th level to select this blade skill.

      *Telekinetic Athleticism:* The psionic energies of the soulknife's mind permeate her body, greatly enhancing her athletic prowess. She gains the benefits of the Mental Leap and Speed of Thought psionic feats while she maintains her psionic focus, and may expend her psychic strike's charge to fuel the secondary abilities of these feats instead of using her psionic focus.

      *Telekinetic Blade:* The soulknife learns to manifest her mind bolt as a melee weapon in addition to its myriad of uses as a ranged one. Selection of this blade skill grants the form mind blade and throw mind blade class features. The soulknife is always considered proficient with her mind blade. The mind blade gains the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind bolt and may select its own enhancements (such as keen or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind bolt. The soulknife must be at least 4th level and have the form mind bolt class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Telekinetic Bolt:* The soulknife learns to manifest her mind blade as a variety of ranged weapons as well as the forms her mind blade normally may take. Selection of this blade skill grants the form mind bolt and launch mind bolt class features (see soulbolt archetype). The soulknife is always considered proficient with her mind bolt. The mind bolt gains the enhancement bonus of the soulknife's mind blade and may select its own enhancements (such as distance or flaming) as if it were a separate weapon from her mind blade. The soulknife may now also take soul bolt specific blade skills. This cannot be taken if you possess the form mind bolt class feature previously. The soulknife must be at least 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Telekinetic Edge:* The soulknife's mind blade can be honed to such a sharp edge that it can pass through a foe's defenses and strike at the softer and more vital bits inside. While psionically focused, the soulknife may expend her psychic strike charge as a free action to ignore a target's damage reduction or an object's hardness until her next turn instead of inflicting additional damage. The soulknife must be at least 4th level to select this blade skill.

      *Telepathic Gift:* The psychic potential within the soulknife opens up telepathic pathways in her mind, allowing her to reach out and connect to the minds of others. She gains telepathy out to a range of 200 feet and can communicate with any creature, regardless of language, so long as they have an Intelligence of 1 or higher. The range of her telepathy increases by 10 feet for every two soulknife levels after. Additionally, as long as she maintains psionic focus, she can detect other creatures within 30 feet using telepathy to communicate, although she cannot determine the content of the communication. The soulknife must be at least 6th level to select this blade skill.

      *Thunder Blade:* When the soulknife makes an attack with his mind blade, he can choose to have it deal sonic damage instead of its normal damage, although the damage of the attack is halved. In addition, the soulknife can expend his psionic focus when he hits with an attack to stagger the target until the end of his next turn unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus). The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Toppling Strike:* If the soulknife's mind blade has the Trip special feature, he may use it to make a single attack at his full base attack bonus as a standard action. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the soulknife can make a free trip attack (using his full base attack bonus) against the same foe. She does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this trip attempt. A soulknife must have the Weapon Special blade skill before selecting this blade skill.

      *Toppling Strike, Improved:* If the soulknife's mind blade has the Trip special feature, he may use it to make a single attack at his full base attack bonus as a standard action. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the soulknife can make a free trip attack (using his full base attack bonus) against the same foe. If he successfully trips that foe, he may make an additional trip attack (using his full base attack bonus) against another foe within reach and adjacent to the first foe. As long as he successfully trips his foe, he may continue to make trip attempts against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are within his reach. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity for these trip attempts. A soulknife must have the Toppling Strike and Weapon Special blade skills before selecting this blade skill.

      *Tower Mind Shield:* The soulknife's mind shield can be shaped into a tower shield. Altering the mind shield in this fashion is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The mind shield remains in this form until shaped back into its standard form. The mind shield is treated in all ways (except visually) as a masterwork tower shield, granting a +4 shield bonus to AC, imposing a +2 Maximum Dexterity Bonus, a -9 Armor Check penalty, and a 50% Arcane Spell Failure Chance. The soulknife must have the Mind Shield blade skill to select this blade skill.

      *Tower Shield Skill:* The soulknife reduces the attack and armor check penalties by 1 (to a minimum of 0) if his mind shield is in tower shield form. The soulknife may take this blade skill multiple times, its effects stack. The soulknife must have the mind shield blade skill and the ability to shape his mind shield into a tower shield to choose this blade skill.

      *Trade Blows:* When the soulknife uses the total defense action, he may make a melee attack at his normal attack bonus on anyone that makes a melee attack against her, regardless of whether the opponent's attack hits. This attack is resolved immediately after the opponent's attack. The soulknife may make one such attack for each attack made against her. If multiple opponents attack he soulknife, each attack he makes must be against the enemy that triggered it. All such attacks are made with a -4 penalty on the attack roll, and are an exception to the rule that you cannot attack during the total defense action. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Trapfinder:* The soulknife gains the Trapfinding ability of a rogue of his level. In addition, the soulknife treats Disable Device as a class skill. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature to select this blade skill.

      *Twin Strike:* When making a single standard attack and wielding two mind blades, the soulknife may attack with both of his mind blades at the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting. She may also utilize this ability when making attacks of opportunity, but not for any other special attacks, unless specifically stated otherwise. The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

      *Two-Handed Throw:* The soulknife gains the ability to throw his mind blade if it is in two-handed form, with a range increment of 10 ft.

      *Vampiric Blade:* The soulknife with knowledge of this art has learned that staying power is sometimes more important than a faster kill. Armed with this skill, the psychic strike of the soulknife's mind blade is capable of being a life-draining conduit to restore the vital energy of the wielder. When the soulknife expends her psychic strike ability on an attack against a living, corporeal creature she may choose to inflict only 1/2 her psychic strike damage and heal an equal amount of hit points.

      *Weapon Special:* The soulknife may assign one of the following specials to his mind blade when he shapes his mind blade: brace, trip, or disarm. She may change the assigned ability by reshaping his mind blade. This blade skill may be taken more than once, allowing the soulknife to assign multiple abilities at once.

      *Whiplash:* The soulknife can throw his mind shield as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10. In addition, by expending psionic focus as a free action after making a ranged attack with his mind shield, the soulknife can cause the shield to return back to his hand, hitting any enemy in line of effect from his target and dealing damage as a light shield. Soulknives with the Form Mind Shield class feature instead deal damage as a heavy shield. The soulknife makes a ranged attack roll for each enemy in the line of effect. The soulknife may not use this blade skill if his mind shield is in the form of a tower shield. The soulknife must be at least 8th level and have the form mind shield class feature to choose this blade skill.

      *Wing Clip:* As a standard action, the soulknife may make a single melee attack against a single creature. If he hits, instead of dealing damage, the vibrations in his mind blade damages the creature's ability to move, rendering it unable to move for a number of rounds equal to the soulknife's Strength modifier (minimum 1). A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus.

      A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 3rd level and every odd level thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus that he may spend on an actual enhancement bonus or on weapon special abilities. A soulknife's level determines his maximum enhancement bonus (see Table: The Soulknife). The soulknife may (and must, when his total enhancement is higher than his maximum bonus) apply any special ability from the table below instead of an enhancement bonus, as long as he meets the level requirements. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities and/or enhancement bonus that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level, but he must assign at least a +1 enhancement bonus before assigning any special abilities.

      If the soulknife shapes his mind blade into two items, the enhancement bonus of his mind blade (if any) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If this would reduce the enhancement bonus on the mind blades to 0 and weapon special abilities are applied, the soulknife must reshape his mind blade to make the options valid. Both mind blades have the same selection of enhancement bonus and weapon special abilities (if any). This penalty does not apply when using the Mind Shield blade skill.

      At 3rd level, the soulknife gains the ability to manifest a small number of psionic powers, which are drawn from the soulknife power list.

      A soulknife chooses his powers from the soulknife power list. At 3rd level, a soulknife knows one soulknife power of your choice. He learns new powers as indicated on Table: The Soulknife. Asoulknife can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The total number of powers a soulknife can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points.

      A soulknife never needs to prepare powers ahead of time; he draws them from his mind when needed. When a soulknife recovers his daily power points after resting, he may choose to rotate one or more powers he knows for new ones. These powers must always be chosen from the soulknife power list, and the maximum number of powers the soulknife may know at any one time in this fashion is listed on Table: The Gifted Blade. If a soulknife learns a power through other means, such as the Expanded Knowledge feat, the Mental Power blade skill, or psychic chirurgery, this power is known in addition to his normal powers. He may never exchange it for another power from the soulknife list when he chooses his powers known, and it doesn't count against his limit of powers known at any one time.

      The Difficulty Class for saving throws against soulknife powers is 10 + the power's level + the soulknife's Wisdom modifier.

      Through 2nd level, a soulknife has no manifester level. At 3rd level and higher, a soulknife's manifester level is equal to his soulknife level --2.

      A soulknife gains the ability to learn 1st-level powers at 3rd level. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, etc), a soulknife gains the ability to master more complex powers, up to 4th level powers at level 15.

      To learn or manifest a power, a soulknife must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.

      A soulknife's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: Soulknife. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. If a soulknife has power points from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class.

      As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with unless he chooses to use it, and the charge is not wasted if an attack misses. Mindless creatures are immune to this damage, although non-mindless creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are affected by this damage as normal. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away.)

      A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Additionally, he may recharge it as a swift action by expending his psionic focus.

      Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used (whether the attack is successful or not). Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.

      If the soulknife forms his mind blade into two weapons, he may imbue each mind blade with psychic strike as normal. If he reshapes his mind blade into a single weapon form, the additional psychic strike imbued into the additional weapon is lost.

      At every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, etc), the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases by 1d8.

    text: A 5th level soulknife may manifest his mind blade as a free action, though he may still only attempt to do so once per round (unless throwing the weapon multiple times using the Multiple Throw blade skill).

  - name: Mind Blade Mastery
    levels: [20]
    text: At 20th level, a soulknife reaches the pinnacle of his art and his connection to his blade is so strong it cannot be severed. She no longer requires a Will save to maintain his mind blade in a null psionics field, although it still loses any enhancement bonus and special abilities. In addition, he may change the configurations of his mind blade's special abilities at will as a full-round action, which also resets any penalties that may have accrued from the Fluid Form and Improved Fluid Form blade skills.

Never caught unarmed, the soulknife is the literal interpretation of using the power of the mind as a weapon. Creating a mind blade is the core of the soulknife, and with it, he is a deadly combatant. Versatile and varied, the soulknife can be found in all shapes and sizes, wielding blades unique to the wielder and customized to fit the needs of the soulknife. Fluid in function, the soulknife has mastered how to alter her mind blade to fit the situation, bringing power and versatility into any combat.

**Role:** As a wielder of a weapon first and foremost, the soulknife excels as a front-line combatant on the battlefield. Her limited armor options and defensive abilities can be a hindrance, but her varied blade abilities can make her an excellent mobile warrior or battlefield controller.
