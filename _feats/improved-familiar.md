title: Improved Familiar
sources:
  - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook
flavor_text: This feat allows you to acquire a powerful familiar, but only when you could normally acquire a new familiar.
prerequisites:
  - Ability to acquire a new familiar
  - compatible alignment
  - sufficiently high level (see below)
benefit: |
  When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available to you. You may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each alignment axis (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).<table>



  Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: if the creature's type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).
