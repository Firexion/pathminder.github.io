title: Elemental Focus
sources:
  - "Path of War: Expanded"
tags:
  - Combat
summary: Specialize in one element to partially ignore resistance and immunity to it
flavor_text: You have chosen a singular element with which to excel.
prerequisites:
  - elemental attunement class feature or one [Elemental Flux](/martial-disciplines/elemental-flux/) maneuver known
benefit: Choose one element available as an active element for the [Elemental Flux](/martial-disciplines/elemental-flux/) discipline. When this element is your active element, your maneuvers that deal damage of that element's associated energy type ignore up to your character level in energy resistance. In addition, starting at character level 10th, creatures that are immune to that element's energy type take half damage instead of none from your attacks and abilities.
